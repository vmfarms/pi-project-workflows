# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Heuristic `announce-without-act` detector — sibling to null-output. Detects substantive thinking + announce-intent visible ("I'll investigate ...", "Let me check ...") + zero tool calls + clean stop, partitioned from null-output by a 50-char visible-length floor + 500-char ceiling + announce-position-within-first-100-chars-of-trimmed-visible constraint. Currently observe-mode (`actions: null`). Env toggle `PI_ANNOUNCE_WITHOUT_ACT_MONITOR=off`. Promotion to steer mode deferred until corpus accumulates 2+ accurate wild fires without FPs. See `heuristic-announce-without-act.ts` + tests.

## [0.14.6] - 2026-04-27

### Changed
- Monitor discovery uses a three-tier multi-location loader (project `.pi/monitors/` > global `~/.pi/agent/monitors/` > bundled `<package>/examples/`) instead of the prior copy-on-first-run `seedExamples()` pattern. Bundled monitor changes (e.g., the `agent_end` routing fix in commit affe992) now propagate to all installations automatically because the bundled tier reads the package examples directly. First match by `monitor.name` wins; same-name shadowing across tiers logs a one-line warning at session_start so drift is visible.
- Existing files in `.pi/monitors/` continue to work as project-level overrides under the new model. To receive bundled-monitor updates, delete the per-monitor files in `.pi/monitors/`. The override warning at session_start identifies which monitors are currently shadowed and where the bundled version lives.

### Removed
- `seedExamples()` and the seeded-count notification — bundled monitors are no longer copied into user `.pi/monitors/` directories at first run.
- `resolveProjectMonitorsDir` export — replaced internally by a private `findProjectMonitorsDir(): string | null` helper that returns null instead of synthesizing a cwd-rooted fallback path.
- Internal `copyDirRecursive` helper — `scripts/generate-skills.js` retains its own private copy.
